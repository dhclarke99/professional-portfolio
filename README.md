# professional-portfolio

## Description

This repositiory is a professional portfolio where I can link other completed projects to showcase my web development abilities to potential employers. 

The process of building this portfilio has helped me learn crucial elements of HTML and CSS and how they can work together in a completed webpage. The biggest takeaway from building this project was the experience using the flex CSS properties to organize a webpage.



## Installation

There is no installation required. The only requirement is the webpage link.

## Usage

To access the webpage use <a href="https://dhclarke99.github.io/professional-portfolio/"> this link</a>
